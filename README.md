# Professional README Generator

## Description
For this week's challenge, we are creating a README.md file using node.js, npm and inquirer. 

## Usage
To use this application, open up the terminal in vscode and enter in 'node index.js'. The terminal will prompt you with questions to help you build your README.md file. Once you answer each question, your README.md file will generate!
